    "# Inverse kinematics\n",
    "This notebook considers the problem of inverse kinematics, ie solving at each control cycle of the robot a quadratic program from the derivatives (jacobian) of the current state. It introduces the basic function to compute the Jacobians of the robot, and how to use them to compute an inverse-kinematics control law. One of the key difficulties is to understand in which frames each quantities is computed (this might be in the world frame, in the local frame attached to the end-effector, in some arbitrary goal frame, etc), as we should never mix quantities expressed in different frames. \n"

However, the prismatic joint and the mobile basis, if actuated, can enter in conflict with the tool task. Still, they can be actuated in such a way that they do not perturb the achievement of the first task while helping with the second one, although it is less trivial to see it.\n",

    "II. Load an extra cube in the viewer to figure a table. First control the robot hand to reach an arbitrary point on the table (don't mind for the collision). Then implement a control law to control three tasks:\n",
    "* the tool frame should be kept on the table (i.e. only the z component of the error matter, select only the 3rd row of the matrix).\n",
    "* the gaze should be controlled to reach the position of a ball object positionned on the table.\n",
    "* the center of the basis frame should reach a given target on the floor. For this task, only the x- and y- component of the task matter, select only the 2 first rows.\n"
